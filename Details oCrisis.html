<h3>What is COVID-19?</h3>
<br>
<p>COVID-19 is the disease caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. WHO first learned of this new virus on 31 December 2019, following a report of a cluster of cases of 'viral pneumonia' in Wuhan, People's Republic of China.</p>
<br>
COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new coronavirus, which has not been previously identified in humans. In most cases, COVID-19 causes mild symptoms including dry cough, tiredness and fever, though fever may not be a symptom for some older people. Other mild symptoms include aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhoea. Some people become infected but don't develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who get COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>How is COVID-19 transmitted?</h3>
<br>
<p>
People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets.</P>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Can adolescents catch COVID-19?</h3>
<br>
<p>
Yes. All age groups can catch COVID-19.
<br>
While we are still learning about how COVID-19 affects people, so far, data suggests that children under the age of 18 years have few deaths compared to other age groups and usually mild disease. However, cases of critical illness have been reported. As with adults, pre-existing medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, asthma, diabetes, obesity, cancer and neurological and developmental conditions are risk factors for severe disease and intensive care admission in children.</p>

<h3>How to prevent infection?</h3>
<p>
To prevent infection, there are a five things that you can do.
<br>
<br>
1. Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water and dry them thoroughly.
You can also use alcohol-based hand rub if your hands are not visibly dirty and if this product is available. Cleaning your hands frequently will remove the virus if it is on your hands. You can learn how to wash your hands hands in this video (or this visual). If an alcohol-based hand rub or soap is not available, then using chlorinated water (0.05%) for handwashing is an option, but it is not ideal because frequent use may irritate your skin.
<br>
<br>
2. Cover your mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when coughing and sneezing.
And remember to throw away the used tissue immediately in a bin with a lid and to wash your hands. This way you protect others from any virus released through coughs and sneezes.
<br>
<br>
3. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.
Hands touch many surfaces which can be contaminated with the virus. If you touch your eyes, nose or mouth with unclean hands, you can transfer the virus from the surface to yourself.
<br>
<br>
4. Keep physical distance from others.
If your national or local authorities have put in place confinement measures, it is important to respect them. Taking exercise outside is good for your physical and mental health, but should only be undertaken if regulations for your area allow it. When you do go out, avoid crowded spaces and maintain at least 1 metre distance (3 feet or arms-length) from others. Avoid unnecessary visits to your house. If visits are necessary (e.g. caregiver to support with activities of daily living), ask your visitor to regularly check for symptoms to ensure that they are symptom free when visiting you. Ask them to also follow these five key actions, including washing their hands when they first enter your home.
<br>
<br>
5. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces every day.
This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, taps, and sinks. If surfaces are dirty, use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. Learn more by clicking here.
<br>
<br>
These are what you can do to prevent infection but to really protect ourselves from the virus we need the vaccine.
<br> (Vaccine Details in the 2nd video below posted 02/21/2021 from World Health Organization's Youtube Channel)
<p>
<br>
Additionally, Probiotics, Ginger, Garlic and more of these very questionnable medications have no evidences of preventing/protecting people from the virus. If you encounter these information, research and dig the internet. (<a href="https://www.who.int/">who.int</a> is one of the most reliable sites)

<h2>Effects of COVID 19 Pandemic: </h2>
<br>
<br>
<font size="4">
<h3>Long-term effects off contracting the disease:</h3>
<p>
Some people who have had COVID-19, whether they have needed hospitalization or not, continue to experience symptoms, including fatigue, respiratory and neurological symptoms.
<br><br>
WHO is working with our Global Technical Network for Clinical Management of COVID-19, researchers and patient groups around the world to design and carry out studies of patients beyond the initial acute course of illness to understand the proportion of patients who have long term effects, how long they persist, and why they occur. These studies will be used to develop further guidance for patient care. </p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Effect to Livelihood:</h3>
<p>
The economic and social disruption caused by the pandemic is devastating: tens of millions of people are at risk of falling into extreme poverty, while the number of undernourished people, currently estimated at nearly 690 million, could increase by up to 132 million by the end of the year. Millions of enterprises face an existential threat. Nearly half of the world’s 3.3 billion global workforce are at risk of losing their livelihoods. Informal economy workers are particularly vulnerable because the majority lack social protection and access to quality health care and have lost access to productive assets. The pandemic has been affecting the entire food system and has laid bare its fragility. Border closures, trade restrictions and confinement measures have been preventing farmers from accessing markets, including for buying inputs and selling their produce, and agricultural workers from harvesting crops, thus disrupting domestic and international food supply chains and reducing access to healthy, safe and diverse diets. Millions of agricultural workers – waged and self-employed – while feeding the world, regularly face high levels of working poverty, malnutrition and poor health, and suffer from a lack of safety and labour protection as well as other types of abuse. With low and irregular incomes and a lack of social support, many of them are spurred to continue working, often in unsafe conditions, thus exposing themselves and their families to additional risks. Further, when experiencing income losses, they may resort to negative coping strategies, such as distress sale of assets, predatory loans or child labour. 
<p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Effect to Education:</h3>
<p>
Before places of worship, restaurants, and shops began to close in response to the coronavirus pandemic, college campuses sent students home. The dominoes started to fall last spring.

On March 6, the University of Washington in Seattle became the first major American college to shut down campus operations. Ten days later, over 250 U.S. colleges and universities followed suit.
College students — most of whom are under 29 years of age — are among the least vulnerable to COVID-19. The China Center for Disease Control found that the COVID-19 fatality rate for the 10-39 age bracket was just 0.2%. The  coronavirus poses the greatest threat to older faculty and staff,  nontraditional students, and those with immunodeficiencies.

Schools' diverse and active populations number in the thousands, all living in close proximity to one another. And as the surge in  college disciplinary action suggests, social distancing measures can be difficult to enforce.

Data shows a looser correlation between open campuses and rising  case numbers than predicted. Some areas experienced short-term spikes in case numbers after the local campus welcomed students back. But counties with college campuses actually logged fewer new COVID-19 cases per day than counties without campuses.

Most campus closures were enacted out of an abundance of caution rather than in response to confirmed cases. Now, many colleges have set a hard limit for how many positive cases their campuses can support before shutting down again.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Effect to Poverty:</h3>
<p>
Using the 2018 Family Income and Expenditure Survey for the baseline poverty profile of NCR, the rest of Luzon and the rest of the Philippines combined with estimated job losses as a
result of the lockdown, ADB simulated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on household incomes and poverty incidence. ADB simulations show without substantial fiscal support to poor and near poor families, the national poverty rate could increase from 16.6% of the population in 2018 to 20.7% in 2020, equivalent to 5.5 million more Filipinos falling into poverty as a result of the pandemic effects on incomes. This represents a 68.6% increase in the number of impoverished persons in NCR and a 31.3% increase in the total number of poor persons in the Philippines threatening to reverse the country’s gains in poverty reduction in recent years. Assuming economic growth returns to its long-term trend in 2021, the poverty incidence is expected to decrease to 20.2% of the population by the end of 2021, higher than 2018 levels, showing long term effects of the pandemic on poverty.

<br>
<h3>Effect to Social Life:</h3>
<p>
The recent Covid-19 pandemic has had significant psychological and social effects on the population. Research has highlighted the impact on psychological well-being of the most exposed groups, including children, college students, and health workers, who are more likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, and other symptoms of distress. Some segments of the population seem to be more exposed to the risk of anxious, depressive, and post-traumatic symptoms because they are more sensitive to stress. As reported in a recent survey administered during the Covid-19 pandemic, children and young adults are particularly at risk of developing anxious symptoms  (Orgilés et al., 2020). The research involved a sample of 1,143 parents of Italian and Spanish children (range 3–18). In general, parents observed emotional and behavioral changes in their children during the quarantine: symptoms related to difficulty concentrating (76.6%), boredom (52%), irritability (39%), restlessness (38.8%), nervousness (38%), sense of loneliness (31.3%), uneasiness (30.4%), and worries (30.1%). Health-care workers (HCWs) are another segment of population particularly affected by stress (Garcia-Castrillo et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2020). HCWs are at risk to develop symptoms common in catastrophic situations, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, burnout syndrome, physical and emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and dissociation (Grassi and Magnani, 2000; Mache et al., 2012; Øyane et al., 2013). However, an epidemic presents different peculiarities compared to a catastrophic event, for instance, the stigmatizing attitudes in particular toward health professionals, who are in daily contact with the risk of infection (Brooks et al., 2020).

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<font size="5">
<br>
<p>
The main effect from the current issue: Covid-19 Pandemic, aside from the virus and disease, is restrictions. More specifically, restrictions when going outside the house and because of this only restriction other restrictions came about; most workers were fired, company businesses has plummeted and children/teens spend most of their times inside their houses. It punched several countries' economy right in the gut, has killed around a couple and half a million(as of 02/24/2021), and made millions of people lose jobs they need to feed their family. However, do not let this grave negative effects blind us of the positive effects. 
<br>
<br>
Doctors and researchers are noticing some curious and unexpectedly positive side effects of the abrupt shifts in human behaviour in response to the covid-19 pandemic. Skies are bluer, fewer cars are crashing, crime is falling, and some other infectious diseases are fading from hospital emergency departments(bmj.com,Bryn Nelson). 
<br>
<br>
It's ironic because this restriction is a negative and a postive effect at the same time, not only to humans but most especially to nature. This only shows that restriction is negative if evaluated individually but is positive if we look at the big picture because restrictions do give peace to us. Just keep in mind that restriction along with every other things are negative if we overdo it. Over Restriction will bind our movement and what will happen is that can't progress. So, even if we achieve peace collectively it would be nothing if each and every individual is binded.
<br>
<br>
What our group wants to convey is that we should take advantage of every materials and situations we have. Even if the Covid Pandemic restricts us do not let it be an excuse to stop doing what you need to do. Yes, it is a large hindrance but if you look at it as an obstacle to strongly overcome, you can experience progression.
